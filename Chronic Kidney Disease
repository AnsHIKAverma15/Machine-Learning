Kidney disease is a major chronic disease associated with aging, hypertension, and diabetes, affecting people 60 and over. Its major cause is the malfunctioning of the kidney in disposing toxins from the blood.
This study analyzes chronic kidney disease using machine learning techniques based on a chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) or chronic renal disease has become a major issue with a steady growth rate. A person can only survive without kidneys for an average time of 18 days, which makes a huge demand for a kidney transplant and
Dialysis.
It is important to have effective methods for early prediction of CKD. Machine learning methods are effective in CKD prediction.
Given 24 health related attributes taken in 2-month period of 400 patients, using the information of the 158 patients with complete records to predict the outcome (i.e. whether one has chronic kidney disease) of the remaining 242 patients (with
missing values in their records).
